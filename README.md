## Description
This is a small personal project that helps users track credit cards, spending progress towards sign-up bonus, rewards, and benefits.

**What is credit card churning:**
- The process involves applying for a credit card, getting approved, meeting a minimum spend within a set amount of time, earning a large welcome bonus, and canceling the card before the next annual fee is due.

**How do I use this?**
- I created this app because checking credit card progress across multiple banking apps can be cumbersome. This would be a central hub for all your cards in one glance.

## Future Roadmap

3. Create an actual credit card API that houses the all info from credit cards. It is currently using my own local database.
